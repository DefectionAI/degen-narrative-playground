VITALIK: (checking monitors) The network looks stable. Proof of Stake is holding.

CHARLES: (skeptically) For now. But you know the Bitcoin maxis are already spinning this as centralization.

VITALIK: (shrugs) What else is new? They called Ethereum a scam when we launched, they called it a scam during the DAO hack, and they're calling it a scam now.

CHARLES: (pauses, looks directly at VITALIK) But what if they're right this time? What if we've just handed the keys to the largest smart contract platform to the richest players?

VITALIK: (stands, faces CHARLES) That's not what happened, and you know it. This is about sustainability, scalability... evolution.

(A notification pings. They both turn to look at a screen showing ETH price dropping rapidly)

CHARLES: (smirking) Evolution, huh? Looks like the market has a different opinion.

VITALIK: (calmly) The code worked. That's what matters. Price will follow fundamentals eventually.

CHARLES: (laughs) Still the idealist. Some things never change.

(The lights flicker. A new figure materializes in the corner of the room)

SATOSHI: (face obscured, voice distorted) Or perhaps some things should never change...

VITALIK & CHARLES: (shocked) Satoshi?!

SAM: (into phone, panicked) No, no, no! Tell them we have the liquidity. We HAVE it!

(CHANGPENG enters, composed but stern)

CHANGPENG: (shaking head) You don't, though. And now everyone knows it.

SAM: (covering phone) What are you doing here? Come to gloat?

CHANGPENG: I came to offer a deal. We can still stop this bank run.

SAM: (bitter laugh) After you practically caused it? Your tweet wasn't an accident.

CHANGPENG: (shrugs) Neither was your balance sheet.

(A REGULATOR bursts through the door, flanked by officials)

REGULATOR: Everyone stop! This exchange is now under investigation.

SAM: (face draining of color) You don't understand, we just need 24 hours...

CHANGPENG: (backing toward exit) I think I'll let you handle this. Offer's officially withdrawn.

(SAM's phone pings repeatedly with withdrawal notifications)

REGULATOR: (grimly) Mr. Bankman-Fried, I suggest you call your lawyers.

DOGE HOLDER: (incredulous) How? HOW? We were the original! We had Elon!

SHIB DEVELOPER: (smugly) And we had a better story. Dog eat dog, my friend.

(A notification sound. They both check their phones)

DOGE HOLDER: (eyes widening) Are you seeing this? Some hamster coin just pumped 1000%.

SHIB DEVELOPER: (dismissively) Flash in the pan. No fundamentals.

(RETAIL INVESTOR enters, wearing pajamas and looking sleep-deprived)

RETAIL INVESTOR: (excited) I just mortgaged my house and went all in on HamsterRocket! The Telegram group says it's going to 100x from here!

SHIB DEVELOPER & DOGE HOLDER: (in unison) Oh no...

RETAIL INVESTOR: (checking phone) Wait... why is it dropping? No, no, NO! It was just at an all-time high!

(A sleek, minimalist desk in the corner suddenly illuminates, revealing VB sitting quietly)

VITALIK: (sighing) And this is why we can't have nice things.

MINER #1: (nervously) Less than an hour now. After this, our rewards get cut in half.

MINER #2: (confidently) But the price will compensate. It always has.

MINER #1: Past performance is not indicative of future results, man. This time could be different.

(A loud bang as the door flies open. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR enters with bodyguards)

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR: (surveying the facility) So this is where the magic happens? Looks... industrial.

MINER #2: (defensively) What did you expect? Unicorns and rainbows? This is serious infrastructure.

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR: (checking expensive watch) And soon to be seriously less profitable. Unless...

MINER #1: (suspiciously) Unless what?

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR: (smiling) Unless you have friends in high places. My fund just acquired a significant position. We have ways to maintain price support through the halving.

MINER #2: Market manipulation? That's not what Bitcoin is about!

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR: (laughs) Oh, that's adorable. You still think this is 2013. Bitcoin is big business now. Idealism doesn't pay the electricity bill.

(Timer beeps, reaches zero. All mining equipment momentarily goes quiet, then restarts)

MINER #1: (looking at screens) It's done. The halving just happened.

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR: (checking phone) And right on cue, our trading desk begins. Gentlemen, I suggest you watch the charts. This will be... educational.

DETECTIVE: (pointing at screen) There. The exploit happened at 3:42 AM. Someone found the vulnerability in your code and drained $45 million in seconds.

DEVELOPER: (distressed) But we had three audits! How did they miss this?

DETECTIVE: (zooming in on code) They were looking at what the code does. Not what it could do when combined with a flash loan attack from another protocol.

(A message appears on screen)

DEVELOPER: (reading) "Return the funds and keep 10% as a bug bounty"? Are they serious?

DETECTIVE: (nodding) White hat offer. Better than nothing.

DEVELOPER: Our users will lynch us either way. The forums are already on fire.

(Door opens, REGULATOR enters with notepad)

REGULATOR: (formally) I have some questions about your "permissionless lending protocol" and how exactly $45 million of consumer funds disappeared overnight.

DEVELOPER: (to DETECTIVE, whispering) Do I need a lawyer?

DETECTIVE: (whispering back) You need a time machine.

REGULATOR: (sternly) I can hear you both. And yes, legal counsel would be advisable. Very advisable.
